# Mobile Manipulation Capstone

This project is my implementation of the [Mobile Manipulation Capstone](https://hades.mech.northwestern.edu/index.php/Mobile_Manipulation_Capstone) from the Modern Robotics course by Northwestern University. The task involves commanding a mobile manipulator to pick up a cube from an initial location and place it at a final location using coordinated motion across its base, arm, and gripper.

## Overview

Software that plans a trajectory for the end-effector of the youBot mobile manipulator (a mobile base with four mecanum wheels and a 5R robot arm), performs odometry as the chassis moves, and performs feedback control to drive the youBot to pick up a block at a specified location, carry it to a desired location, and put it down.

Tools used: Python, Modern Robotics Library, CoppeliaSim.
